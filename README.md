# Schizophrenia Mortality Analysis

This project explores the relationship between schizophrenia, intellectual disabilities, and mortality using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify significant predictors contributing to increased mortality risk among affected individuals, drawing from a clean and structured healthcare dataset.

## Project Overview

Using Python and libraries like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and SHAP, this notebook walks through the data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and interpretability of the models used.

Key steps include:

- Data cleaning, encoding, and handling missing values
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model training using Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and SVM
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC
- Interpretability using SHAP values for global and local feature importance

## Visualisations and Interpretation

Multiple visualisations are included to show:
- Model performance comparisons
- Feature importances
- SHAP plots for understanding how features affect predictions

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
